| Code Quality                         | Excellent | Generates well-structured, production-ready code in multiple languages. Strong at refactoring, testing, and design patterns.             | Good          | Claude Sonnet generates well-structured and readable code.The generated code may need minor refactoring. | Good         | Generates clean and readable code, especially for front-end.Additional refinement for backend logic or complex error handling. | Good                  | Capable of generating functional code snippets for simple tasks, but may require heavy refactoring for production use.       |
| SQL Generation                       | Excellent | Generates accurate, optimized SQL queries, even for complex joins, CTEs, window functions, and nested queries.                           | Excellent     | Claude Sonnet excels in SQL generation. It understands natural-language prompts well and produces highly accurate, optimized queries. | Good         | Capable of generating accurate SQL queries for typical use cases,when provided with detailed schema context.        | Basic or Limited      | Can write basic SQL queries (e.g., simple SELECTs, basic joins) may fall short in logic-heavy scenarios.                   |
| Infrastructure Automation (Scripts), | Good      | Good at developing DevOps scripts in Terraform, Bash, Ansible,CICD pipelines. Would need prompt tuning for complex edge cases.        | Good          | Supports Terraform, K8s YAML, Python, CICD pipelines… may be limited with deeply specialized tools or cloud-specific solutions. | Good         | Works well for basic DevOps scripts: Bash, IaC, cloud automation, Helm charts, or multi-account setups.             | Good                  | Can output standard Bash scripts, Dockerfiles, or Kubernetes YAML for basic use cases. Doesn’t handle tool-specific logic.     |
| Ease of Use                          | Excellent | Intuitive responses, automatically adds context or assumptions… can handle poorly-structured input and still deliver useful results. | Good          | Most compatible with AWS Bedrock/other cloud models. May need more structured input for highly technical workflows.      | Good         | Simple and responsive for most prompts. May need reminders or rephrased prompts for complex context.              | Basic or Limited      | Requires very specific, structured prompts to generate useful output… e.g., variable names, file structure, flags.              |
| Speed/Latency                        | Good      | Rapid responses in most cases. For longer code blocks or multi-part conversations, latency can increase slightly.                         | Good          | Ideal for quick-turnaround workflows.Slight delay may appear on long or multi-step queries.                          | Excellent    | Very low latency—one of the fastest models. Delivers almost immediate responses, ideal for real-time development and terminal helpers. | Good                  | Since it runs locally via Ollama, response time is extremely fast,great for disconnected workflows or low-latency environments.  |
